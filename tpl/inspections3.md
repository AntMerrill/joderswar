# Mindy’s “Contractor Shell Game” — How It Works

Mindy uses a predictable pattern — a **contractor shell game** — where she invokes the appearance of licensed, insured, compliant contracting while actually deploying an unlicensed, unqualified worker to perform demolition and plumbing work. She then misattributes responsibility to Merrill, the only qualified tradesperson onsite.

## I. Summary of Pattern

1. **Claims of needing licensed contractors**  
   Mindy repeatedly told Merrill that all work “must be done by contractors,” that “insurance is required,” and that he was prohibited from performing corrective tasks.

2. **Use of unlicensed labor**  
   Despite these claims, she brought in **Vance**, who:
   - Tore out the water heater and supply lines  
   - Removed tub, toilet, and tile  
   - Installed a metal tub on a non–wet-wall partition  
   - Performed plumbing and electrical-adjacent work without bonding, vapor barrier, or correct fasteners  

3. **Excluding Merrill — the only qualified tradesman**  
   Mindy prevented Merrill from intervening, even as hazardous conditions were being created.

4. **Later criminalization of Merrill’s corrective actions**  
   After unlicensed work caused structural and safety problems, Mindy reported that Merrill alone caused the damage.

5. **Retroactive narrative shift**  
   When the City became involved, Mindy recast Vance as merely a “helper,” claiming she had “no idea” contractors were required.

This is the **contractor shell game**:  
Invoke licensed-contractor rules to restrict Merrill, then ignore those same rules to bring in an unlicensed worker, and finally shift blame when issues arise.

# II. Text Message Evidence Establishing Knowledge of Contractor Requirements

Screenshots (IMG_7206–IMG_7213) show Mindy:

- Referring explicitly to “contractors”
- Coordinating contractor schedules
- Assigning contractors specific tasks
- Explaining delays based on contractor availability
- Acknowledging that tasks remained for “them” to complete

These messages occurred **before** any police report or permit activity and contradict her later claims of ignorance.

# III. Onsite Conduct Contradicting Her Statements

### What Mindy Told Merrill  
- “We need licensed contractors.”  
- “You can’t do this without insurance.”  
- “Only the contractors can do this.”  

### What Mindy Actually Did  
- Hired Vance — not licensed, not insured, not trained  
- Permitted him to conduct demolition, plumbing, and structural modifications  
- Allowed unsafe, non-code-compliant work to proceed  
- Prevented Merrill from fixing hazardous errors  

Her conduct is inconsistent with her claimed concern for contractor compliance.

# IV. Legal Significance

### 1. Evidence of False Statements  
Her assertion that she “did not know contractors were required” is disproven by the text messages.

### 2. Liability for Unlicensed Contracting  
Using Vance for regulated plumbing and structural work shows awareness and disregard of permitting and safety requirements.

### 3. Misattribution of Responsibility  
Blaming Merrill contradicts:
- The timeline of unlicensed demolition  
- Her own directive preventing him from working  
- Her contemporaneous references to contractor-led responsibilities  

These contradictions implicate credibility and motive.
