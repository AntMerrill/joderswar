# Executive Summary

This master document consolidates **all photographic, chronological, permitting, and inspection evidence** for the
property at **10167 W Maymie Rd, Boise, Idaho**.

It demonstrates the following:

1. **Unpermitted plumbing and electrical work was underway in September 2025**, performed by Mindy Rex’s worker (“Vance”).  
2. **City of Boise opened an investigation (MIS25-00190) on October 2, 2025** confirming multi-system construction without permits.  
3. **City issued a Stop Work Order (MIS25-00194) on October 8, 2025** due to electrical and plumbing violations.  
4. **Mindy filed a retroactive permit (BLD25-03020) on October 22, 2025**, mischaracterizing the work as “repair.”  
5. **On November 12, 2025**, the City issued two major permits:
   - **ELE25-03631** — new circuits, electric water heater conversion, outlet testing  
   - **PLM25-04515** — full replacement of supply lines, fixtures, valves, tub, vanities, and addition of new fixtures  
6. These permits confirm a **full remodel**, not a “repair,” validating Merrill’s photographic evidence from September–October.  
7. The newly scheduled **inspections on November 13, 2025** demonstrate that the City now recognizes the full scope of the remodeling.

This is the most complete and accurate reconstruction of events to date.

# Section 2 — Key Permit Exhibits (City of Boise)

## P-1 — MIS25-00190 (Opened Oct 2, 2025)

**Description:** “Upgrading the property doing electrical, mechanical, plumbing, building without any permits.”  
**Inspector:** Gideon Cross  
**Relevance:** Establishes that unpermitted work began before Merrill’s corrective actions.

---

## P-2 — MIS25-00194 Stop Work Order (Oct 8, 2025)

**Issued by:** Electrical Inspector Mark Moncarr  
**Reason:** Unpermitted electrical + plumbing work  
**Relevance:** Confirms multi-system violations already present.

---

**Filed by:** Mindy Rex  
**Description:** “Repair of finishes and two doors after plumbing work”  
**Relevance:** Minimizes the scope of work, conflicting with City’s investigation record and photos.

---

## P-4 — “New Plan” Sketch Submitted Nov 2, 2025

Sketch submitted as justification for retroactive permit; misstates conditions, timing, and origin of demolition.

# Section 3 — Newly Issued Permits (Nov 12, 2025)

## P-5 — Electrical Permit ELE25-03631 (Issued Nov 12, 2025)

**Applicant:** Mindy Rex  
**Scope:**  
- Convert **gas** water heater to **electric**  
- Add new circuits for **minibar** and **laundry in front bedroom**  
- “Test and update” existing outlets  
**Inspector:** Mark Moncarr  
**Who Performs Work:** Homeowner  
**Valuation:** $1,500

**Significance:**  
This confirms major electrical remodeling was underway — consistent with Merrill’s September electrical hazard documentation.

---

## P-6 — Plumbing Permit PLM25-04515 (Issued Nov 12, 2025)

**Applicant:** Mindy Rex  
**Scope:**  
- Replace **all incoming water supply lines**

# Section 6 — Conflict Analysis Table

| Mindy Rex Claim | City Records Show | Actual Evidence |
|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Merrill “tore out walls” | MIS25-00190 opened Oct 2 for work already underway | Photos show demolition by Vance |
| Merrill “damaged plumbing” | PLM25-04515 calls for full replacement | Photos show unsafe plumbing pre-existed |
| Merrill “damaged electrical” | ELE25-03631 adds new circuits + WH conversion | Photos show electrical hazards from outset |
| Only “repairs” were needed | PLM/ELE permit scopes describe full-system remodel | Photographs show full demolition |
| Merrill caused unsafe conditions | Stop Work Order predates Merrill’s corrective actions | Conditions existed before intervention |

---

# Section 7 — Legal and Administrative Findings

1. **City’s November permits validate Merrill’s September photographic evidence.**
2. Mindy’s retroactive BLD25-03020 permit minimized the true scope of work.
3. The homeowner-performed designation raises compliance concerns.
4. The Stop Work Order + new inspections confirm the full remodel was known to the City.
5. Merrill’s actions were corrective and safety-driven — not destructive.
