# Mindy’s “Contractor Shell Game” — How It Works

Mindy uses a predictable pattern — a **contractor shell game** — where she finesses the language of licensed, insured contracting, yet brings in an unlicensed worker to perform carpentry, plumbing, and electrical alterations without a sitemap or a plan. She then rewrites the narrative to shift responsibility onto Merrill — the only tradesperson on site with actual carpentry and experience **building to code**.

---

# I. Summary of the Pattern

1. **She tells Merrill that “everything must be done by contractors,” “insurance is required,” and he is not allowed to interfere.**

2. **She hires Vance**, an unlicensed and unqualified worker, to perform tasks that:
   - Require training
   - Affect structural integrity
   - Require permits
   - Impact electrical adjacency
   - Demand wet-wall compliance, vapor barriers, and bonding

3. **She diminishes Merrill’s qualifications**, despite him being the only competent tradesman on the property and the only person who identified the relevant code-compliance problems.

4. **She mischaracterizes Vance as a “helper”** when she wants to lie her ass off on the stand.

5. **She later criminalizes Merrill’s corrective actions**, even though his limited interventions were the only competent efforts made on the site. He is charged **with a felony** for the corrective action described herewith.

This sequence is the essence of the **contractor shell game**.

# II. Text Messages That Prove Knowledge of Contractor Requirements

The text messages (IMG_7206–IMG_7213) show Mindy:

- Referring to “the contractors”
- Discussing their schedule
- Explaining delays based on contractor availability
- Mentioning tasks the contractors “still need to do”
- Describing them as responsible for the plumbing and interior work

These messages occurred **before** police reports, retroactive permits, or her claims of “not knowing contractors were required.”  
They are direct evidence of her knowledge and intent.

# III. The Actual Onsite Reality — What Merrill Identified, and What Vance Did

## A. Merrill’s Observations 

Merrill identified immediately that the interior “piss‑partition” revealed after Vance knocks the tiles off:

- Was **not original to the structure** (a post‑factory modification)  
- Had been **saturated for decades** from bathroom leakage  
- **Could not legally serve as a wet‑wall** in any conforming build  
- **Had to be removed** for any safe reconstruction

This was not optional. It was a **technical and sanitary requirement**.

There was **no site plan**, **no construction map**, and **no design**.  
Merrill was the only person putting the time and effort to do the real diagnostic work. Not Mindy. Not Vance.

---

## B. What Mindy Told Merrill

Mindy repeatedly told Merrill:

- “We need licensed contractors.”
- “You can’t do anything without insurance.”
- “Only the contractors can do this.”
- “They’re going to install supply.”

These statements were used to **undercut Merrill’s expertise and standing as the tenant** while simultaneously justifying bringing in her own worker. This was literally happening in Merrill's bedroom. (room 2)

---

## C. What Mindy Actually Did: Vance’s Actions

Instead of “installing supply,” Vance:

1. **Installed the metal tub where it could not legally go**, attaching it directly to the compromised partition Merrill had already identified as non‑compliant.

2. **Over‑fastened the tub**, not with a reasonable tack‑in, but with excessive fasteners that made later corrective removal damaging and unavoidable.

3. **Fastened the tub to the “piss‑partition”**, ensuring that:
   - The tub had to come out if the partition came out  
   - The partition had to come out because it could not be part of a conforming wet‑wall  
   - Therefore: **Vance’s installation forced the removal of both**

4. **Performed work unrelated to “installing supply,”** contradicting Mindy’s explanation for his presence.

5. **Created unsafe and non‑conforming conditions**, including:
   - No vapor barrier  
   - No bonding  
   - Improper fasteners  
   - Electrical adjacency hazards  
   - Ignoring the structural requirements of a wet‑wall  

---

## D. Merrill’s Corrective Work Was Minimal and Necessary

Merrill removed **only** what had to be removed:

- The **partition**, because it was a non‑code, saturated, unsafe post‑factory addition.
- The **tub**, because Vance’s over‑fastening made it impossible to remove the partition without removing the tub.
- **Targeted exploratory holes** to locate supply, vent, and electrical runs — the only way to determine what *should* have been present but was not.


---

## E. Vance’s Later Framing Was Reckless

Vance then moved to **Room 1**, where he:

- Framed  all the walls and then green-rocked them all **immediately**, because he's a Doofus.  
- Ignored:
  - Electrical runs  
  - Venting  
  - Backing  
  - Load path  
- Worked **with no supervision**  
- Installed drywall (“rocked over”) without:
  - Inspection  
  - Documentation  
  - Photographs  
  - Any form of verification  

The only insight into the interior of that wall came from **Merrill’s exploratory openings**, which revealed:

- **Missing venting**  
- **Unknown electrical routing**  
- **No compliant plumbing**  
- **No structural backing for fixtures, grab bars and the like**

Mindy has **no photographs**, because **there was nothing compliant to photograph**.

## F. Photographic Evidence of Vance’s Demolition and Improper Tub Installation

### A — Before Vance’s Tub Installation (Room 2 – Sept 10–11, 2025)

|:--:|:--:|
| Original post-factory partition showing long-term saturation. | Structural view confirming it cannot be a wet-wall in any conforming build.|

**Findings:**  
- Post-factory Masonite partition saturated for decades.  
- Cannot serve as a wet wall.  
- Must be removed for sanitary and structural compliance.  

### B — Vance’s Improper Tub Installation (Room 2 – Sept 13, 2025)

|:--:|:--:|
| Over-fastened tub attached directly to unsafe partition. | Merrill’s minimal corrective removal after discovering unsafe fastening.|

**Violations Created by Vance:**  
- Tub installed on non‑wet‑wall partition (**IRC R702.3.7**).  
- Over-fastening made removal damaging and unavoidable.  
- No vapor barrier, no bonding (**NEC 250.104**).  
- Electrical adjacency hazards.  
- Work not related to “installing supply,” contradicting Mindy’s explanation.

### C — Why Removal Was Necessary  
- Partition had to be removed due to long-term saturation and non-compliance.  
- Tub had to be removed because Vance fastened it directly to the failing partition.  
- Exploratory openings required to locate missing supply and vent lines.

# IV. Legal Significance

1. **Her statements are contradicted by her own messages.**  
   She clearly knew contractors were required.

2. **Her choice to use unlicensed labor shows disregard for truth.**

3. **Her narrative that Merrill caused damage is inconsistent with:**
   - Vance’s demolition  
   - Vance’s incompetent tub placement  
   - Merrill’s limited corrective actions  
   - The physical reality of the walls  

4. Her retroactive reframing of Vance as a **“helper”** is inconsistent with the work he supposedly performed qua **"contractor."**

These contradictions go directly to **credibility, motive, and liability**.
