# Overview

This document compiles the **November 12–13, 2025 City of Boise inspection and permit activity**, including:

- Newly issued **Electrical Permit ELE25-03631** (Mindy Rex, “repair,” homeowner-performed)
- Newly issued **Plumbing Permit PLM25-04515** (Mindy Rex, “replace all supply, valves, fixtures…”)
- City inspection scheduling screenshots (Nov 12, Nov 13)
- A comparative narrative showing the drastic gap between what was claimed and what inspections now require
- Placement of these events within the larger timeline of unpermitted work and false reporting

The City's issuance of two **expansive repair/replace permits** on November 12, 2025 directly confirms that:
1. The **work was already underway prior to permit issuance**, and  
2. The scope described in the permits matches the conditions Merrill documented across September–October.

These new records should be treated as **material admissions** by the City and record applicant.

# Section 1 — Newly Issued Permits (Nov 12, 2025)

## Exhibit I-1 — Electrical Permit ELE25-03631 (Issued 11/12/25)

*Source: Public Summary for Record No. ELE25-03631*

**Key Details:**
- **Applicant:** Mindy Rex  
- **Scope:**  
  - “Improve electrical for new electrical water heater where previous was gas”  
  - “Add electrical service for minibar and laundry in front bedroom”  
  - “Test and update existing outlets”
- **Who is doing the work:** *Homeowner*
- **Inspection:** Conference scheduled 11/13/2025 with Inspector Mark Moncarr
- **Valuation:** $1,500

**Relevance:**  
The permit acknowledges **major electrical alterations**—including conversion from gas to electric water heater, new circuits for bedroom laundry, minibar wiring, and outlet remediation.  
This matches Merrill’s photographic documentation of unsafe and incomplete electrical conditions in September–October.

## Exhibit I-2 — Plumbing Permit PLM25-04515 (Issued 11/12/25)

*Source: Public Summary for Record No. PLM25-04515*

**Key Details:**
- **Applicant:** Mindy Rex  
- **Scope:**  
  - “Replace all incoming water supply lines”
  - “Replace gas water heater with new electric water heater”
  - “Replace valves and fixtures on all plumbing”
  - “Replace vanities and tub and surround”
  - “Switch shower to tub/shower on north bathroom”
  - “Add bar sink to north bedroom”
  - “Add laundry hookups to north bedroom”
- **Total Fixtures:** 11
- **Inspection:** Rough-in scheduled 11/13/2025 with Inspector Eric Strole

**Relevance:**  
This permit is effectively an **admission of full-house plumbing reconstruction**, confirming Merrill’s evidence that a plumbing remodel was underway **long before any permit filings**.

This contradicts prior claims that Merrill “damaged” or “tore out” plumbing; the permit itself confirms the work involved full replacement.

# Section 3 — Integrated Timeline Narrative (Nov 12–13, 2025 in Context)

```
Sept 5–6       Merrill documents subfloor defects and unsafe conditions
Sept 10–13     Merrill documents unbonded metal tub, wet-wall hazards, proximity to outlets
Sept 23–24     Merrill documents demolition debris, rimboard spikes, inconsistent prep
Oct 1–2        Texts confirm lawful occupancy; reports of unsafe conditions
Oct 2          City opens MIS25-00190 for unpermitted work
Oct 8          Stop Work Order MIS25-00194 issued (electrical and plumbing)
Oct 22         Mindy files retroactive BLD25-03020 (claimed “repair of finishes”)
Nov 2          Mindy submits “New Plan” drawing attempting to reframe history
Nov 12         City issues ELE25-03631 and PLM25-04515 (major electrical + plumbing)
Nov 13         Inspections scheduled for electrical conference + plumbing rough-in
```

**Interpretation:**  
The November 12 permits confirm that the real work occurring at the property was:  
- extensive  
- multi-system  
- already underway in September  
- unpermitted at the time  
- and later re-labeled as “repair.”

This reinforces Merrill’s documentation and invalidates the narrative that Merrill caused the conditions.

# Section 4 — Significance for Counsel and City Review

1. **The new permits match—point for point—the hazards Merrill documented months earlier.**
2. The City’s issuance of full-system replacement permits contradicts Mindy’s “repair” narrative.
3. The homeowner-performed declaration raises licensing and liability issues.
4. The inspection schedule shows the City now confirming the scope Merrill originally described.
5. This timeline creates an **official record** supporting:  
   - False reporting  
   - Retaliatory misrepresentation  
   - Misuse of the permitting process  
   - Mischaracterization of Merrill’s corrective actions
