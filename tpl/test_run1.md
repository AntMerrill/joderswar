# Test Exhibit — IMG_7200

This is a minimal test document to confirm that the new **runs/** layout and
the **resized** images are working correctly.

Below is the image we processed via `phone_import.sh` from `images/exhibit2`,
stored under:

`runs/2025-11-15_run1/resized/2025-11-08__IMG_7200.JPG`
