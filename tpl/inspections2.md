# Overview

This exhibit integrates **all City of Boise permitting and inspection activity** at **10167 W Maymie Rd** with the
false and retaliatory narrative advanced by **Mindy Rex**.

The goal is to show, in one place, that:

- Unpermitted **plumbing and electrical work** was underway before Merrill Jensen took corrective action.  
- The City opened an **investigation** and issued a **Stop Work Order** *before* Mindy’s retroactive filings.  
- Mindy then used **retroactive permits** and an advocacy-style “New Plan” sketch to shift blame onto Merrill.  
- On **November 12–13, 2025**, Mindy obtained **new electrical and plumbing permits** that admit a full remodel,
  not a “repair,” and scheduled inspections that align with Merrill’s earlier photographic evidence.

This document is structured so that an inspector, City official, or judge can understand the **timeline**, the
**paper trail**, and the **misrepresentations** in a single sitting.

# Section D — Integrated Conflict Analysis

| Mindy Rex Claim | City Records Show | Merrill’s Evidence Shows |
|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| “Merrill tore out walls.” | MIS25 investigations opened before her claims. | Work already unsafe; Vance did demolition. |
| “Merrill damaged plumbing.” | PLM25-04515 describes full reconstruction. | Photos confirm unsafe plumbing prior. |
| “Merrill damaged electrical.” | ELE25-03631 adds new circuits + WH conversion. | Photos show electrical hazards preexisting. |
| “Only repairs.” | Records show remodel-level scope. | Photos confirm remodel already underway. |
